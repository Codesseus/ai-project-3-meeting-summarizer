[00:00:00]Meet John, a talented programmer who was looking to start a company that used his personally
[00:00:05]developed mobile application to connect restaurants and customers for booking and reservations.
[00:00:10]Even though the app was ready, John had difficulty getting together a team for his startup, needing
[00:00:16]separate people for sales, marketing, programming, content creation, and customer support.
[00:00:21]Hiring reliable manpower while being strict with his budget was getting difficult.
[00:00:27]He reached out to his friend Ryan, who said John could start his company without hiring
[00:00:31]any new people, thanks to just a single AI-based tool.
[00:00:36]John couldn't believe it, which led Ryan to introduce ChatGPT, the revolutionary AI
[00:00:41]chatbot being developed by OpenAI.
[00:00:44]It is a state-of-the-art natural language processing, or NLP, model that uses a neural
[00:00:49]network architecture to provide responses.
[00:00:52]This means that the ChatGPT bot can answer questions without being explicitly told what
[00:00:58]the answer is using its own intellect, unlike previous AI chatbots.
[00:01:02]So, how does ChatGPT help John in filling out his team?
[00:01:08]Regarding sales, ChatGPT can provide full-fledged sales pitches based on the correct prompts.
[00:01:13]It can provide tips on how to pitch your product to businesses, removing the need for sales
[00:01:19]Completely customized to your requirements and your prompts, if you don't like some
[00:01:23]things about the response, you can ask for certain changes, and the chatbot will make
[00:01:28]sure they are done.
[00:01:29]When it comes to marketing, ChatGPT can provide efficient marketing strategies, which can
[00:01:34]help new entrepreneurs learn how to market their products to prospective clients.
[00:01:38]It can provide trending keywords that marketers can use for SEO purposes, while providing
[00:01:43]ad copies for your website and blog.
[00:01:46]Speaking of websites, since John can do a lot of the heavy lifting in programming, ChatGPT
[00:01:51]can help proofread the code and help out when looking for bugs to fix.
[00:01:56]Apart from basic bug fixing, it can also provide sample code structures for different programming
[00:02:01]languages, allowing John to focus more on improving core functionality and workflow
[00:02:05]rather than fixing basic code errors.
[00:02:09]Websites and blogs content is very helpful in gathering potential customer leads.
[00:02:15]The revolutionary bot can provide full-length blog posts with near-perfect fast accuracy
[00:02:21]in seconds, allowing further customization, like choosing the length of a subject matter
[00:02:26]to the complexity of language.
[00:02:28]For John's customer support, the bot can draft complete customer service emails based
[00:02:33]on the situation, saving time and resources.
[00:02:37]The tone of the message can be changed to reflect the nature of the message, creating
[00:02:41]an efficient alternative for call-centered professionals.
[00:02:44]John was left speechless seeing this level of versatility from ChatGPT and wanted to
[00:02:49]implement it right away.
[00:02:51]However, Ryan made sure John knew about some drawbacks of the chatbot before getting started.
[00:02:57]Since the bot is trained mostly on data up to 2021, many of the newer events may still
[00:03:02]need to be discovered by ChatGPT.
[00:03:04]Even basic stuff like asking about the current date and time is beyond its scope.
[00:03:09]Much like the limited understanding of context despite providing near-lifelike solutions
[00:03:13]to certain problems.
[00:03:15]Even the accuracy of many responses can be questioned since the AI model is still learning
[00:03:19]and being developed.
[00:03:21]There is a section of the public that believes the revolutionary tool can one day replace
[00:03:25]Google Search.
[00:03:26]But that day seems far-fetched so far because of the variety of issues people keep running
[00:03:31]into when using ChatGPT.
[00:03:33]So here's a question for you.
[00:03:35]Which of the following tasks cannot be carried out by ChatGPT?
[00:03:41]1. Provide latest news 2. Complex mathematical calculations
[00:03:45]3. Food recipes 4. None of the above
[00:03:51]Think about it and leave your answers in the comment section and we will provide the answer
[00:03:56]next week.
[00:03:57]Give the correct answer along with your reasoning and stand a chance to win an Amazon voucher.
[00:04:02]However, ChatGPT poses a lot of promise for the future of AI.
[00:04:06]From full-scaled automated divisions and organizations to serving as the perfect digital
[00:04:11]assistant, OpenAI is creating a bot for the future aimed at solving the problems of today
[00:04:17]with the tools of tomorrow.
[00:04:19]The ability to carry out a myriad of tasks with minimum manpower will boost productivity
[00:04:23]at organizations in every sector, thanks to the revolutionary ChatGPT.
[00:04:29]So how do you think ChatGPT will benefit your daily life?
[00:04:33]Are you looking forward to using the bot regularly for work or personal life?
