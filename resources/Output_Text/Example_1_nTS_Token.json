    "[00:00:00]Hi Brent here where tech is made simple.",
    "I've had a couple of requests over the\n[00:00:06]last while on how to download and install a Windows update manually.",
    "Now I\n[00:00:11]know a lot of you know how to do this already but in this video I will just\n[00:00:14]demonstrate for those who don't and answer the question on how to download\n[00:00:19]and install a Windows update manually.",
    "Now Windows updates are delivered to the\n[00:00:24]Windows operating system through the Windows update process and for whatever\n[00:00:28]reason the update will not download and install correctly through the Windows\n[00:00:32]update process you have an alternative solution where you can go and download\n[00:00:38]the update manually from the Microsoft update catalog and normally the download\n[00:00:43]the manual download and installation will get the update to install correctly\n[00:00:48]if it is not working properly in the Windows update download and installation\n[00:00:52]process.",
    "Now online you just go and do a search for Microsoft update catalog and\n[00:00:58]when you open the update catalog it'll just start in the welcome screen and in\n[00:01:03]the search you just enter the update that you are trying to get installed.",
    "Now\n[00:01:08]as an example I'm just going to use last week's Patch Tuesday cumulative update\n[00:01:13]which rolled out which was KB5005033 and then you just hit\n[00:01:19]enter and on the left you will see all the Windows 10 versions that that update\n[00:01:25]applies to.",
    "Now if you don't know what version of Windows 10 you are using you\n[00:01:30]just head into your Windows settings system go down to the bottom and just\n[00:01:35]click on about and that will give you all the details if it's a 32-bit 64-bit\n[00:01:40]you know what version you're using and so on and that will answer and you know\n[00:01:45]get you to see what version of Windows 10 you're using if you don't know and\n[00:01:49]then I'm using Windows 10 version 21h 164-bit so if I click on that actual\n[00:01:57]update it gives me all the update details we can see it's 609.4 megabytes\n[00:02:03]in size gives you the overview and you can actually go to Microsoft support to\n[00:02:08]see what the update actually addresses you have package details and yeah it\n[00:02:13]says the update replaces the following updates so you can actually see what\n[00:02:19]other updates you have previously installed that this update is actually\n[00:02:22]going to be replacing which is quite handy and then install resources can\n[00:02:27]request restart and so on and if we close that and we just head back to that\n[00:02:31]entry 21h 164-bit and I go to the download and I click on that it tells me\n[00:02:39]a cumulative update for Windows 10 version 21h1 and that's for 64-bit\n[00:02:44]operating systems KB5005033 now that's exactly how it appears in the\n[00:02:50]Windows update and it's exactly the same update that you would get through the\n[00:02:54]Windows update in Windows 10 and then we just click on the download link and now\n[00:02:59]you have two options you can actually click on open where the if you don't\n[00:03:05]know where your download location is this will download and then once the\n[00:03:09]download is finished it will start the installation process automatically and\n[00:03:13]as in this example I'm just going to go save it to my download location on my\n[00:03:19]hard drive and I'm going to go save as now I've already downloaded the update\n[00:03:23]and as it will take too long to demonstrate in this video and once it's\n[00:03:27]downloaded obviously then you just head over to your download location on your\n[00:03:33]PC and mine is in my file explorer and downloads and here is the package\n[00:03:39]Windows 10 update KB5005033 and then all you do is you double click on that\n[00:03:45]package to start the installation process now it says Windows update\n[00:03:50]standalone installer preparing the installation now depending on obviously\n[00:03:55]the size and speed of your computer this can take a while so basically what it's\n[00:03:59]doing is just preparing like any other exe file and package it's preparing the\n[00:04:04]installation to be installed onto your Windows operating system and it should\n[00:04:09]be finishing shortly as I have run this already and now it's searching for\n[00:04:12]updates on this computer and once again like the previous step this depends on\n[00:04:17]the size and speed of your operating system and just like any update in\n[00:04:22]Windows update it's searching for updates on this computer so it's just the\n[00:04:26]manual way of doing the Windows update process on your Windows operating system\n[00:04:31]and this should be finishing soon searching for updates on this computer\n[00:04:37]and there we go now what will happen here is it'll ask you then if you want\n[00:04:45]to install it now you can see that Windows update standalone installer I\n[00:04:48]already have the update on my computer so it won't let me install it so it's\n[00:04:53]actually a safety net if you already have that update installed it'll just\n[00:04:57]tell you this update is already installed so what you do if obviously\n[00:05:02]you are downloading it and it's finished searching you just say install and then\n[00:05:06]you just follow the steps for the installation process and then you\n[00:05:10]will have to restart your PC to apply the update and that is basically how you\n[00:05:16]download and install a Windows update manually on your machine if it is not\n[00:05:22]downloading correctly through the Windows update process and then when you\n[00:05:26]go back to your Windows update you will actually see the update if you go to\n[00:05:30]view update history you will actually see it in the update list on your PC as it\n[00:05:37]will be installed just like any normal update and that you would have installed\n[00:05:41]through the Windows update process so I hope you found this video useful once\n[00:05:46]again thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one"
