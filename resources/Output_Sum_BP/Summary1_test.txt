He then selects the update for Windows 10 version 21H1 64-bit, showing the details of the update including its size and what previous updates it replaces.

Brent then shows how to navigate to the download location and initiate the installation by double-clicking the downloaded file. He describes the installation process, including the system's verification of the need for the update and the final steps to complete the installation. This section is particularly detailed, providing viewers with a step-by-step guide on how to execute the installation once the update file is downloaded. [00:02:50-00:05:46]
